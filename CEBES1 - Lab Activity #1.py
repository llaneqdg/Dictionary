    "ACOUSTICS":"The science concerned with the study of sound, including its production, transmission, and effects. Acoustics encompasses a wide range of topics such as sound wave propagation in various media, the design of spaces to enhance sound quality, noise control, and the development of audio equipment.",
    "ACTUATOR":"A component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system by converting energy (typically electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic) into mechanical motion.",
    "BIMETALLIC STRIP":"Consists of two different metals bonded together. When heated, the metals expand at different rates, causing the strip to bend, which is commonly used in temperature sensors.",
    "BIOENGINEERING":"An interdisciplinary field that applies principles and methods from engineering to the study of biological systems and the development of technologies to improve human health and the environment.

Catalysis allows reactions to occur more quickly and often at lower temperatures or pressures. Catalysts function by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy.",
    "DESALINATION":"The process of removing salts and other impurities from seawater or brackish water to produce fresh water that is suitable for drinking, irrigation, or industrial use. This process is critical in regions with limited access to freshwater resources.",
    "DIODE":"A semiconductor device with two terminals, typically allowing the flow of current in one direction only, often used in circuits for rectifying alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).",
    "ENTROPY":"A measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. In thermodynamics, it quantifies the amount of energy in a physical system that cannot be used to do work.",
    "FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS":"Also known as FEA, is a computational method for predicting how objects react to real-world forces, vibration, heat, and other physical effects by breaking down a large problem into smaller, simpler parts called finite elements.",
    "GEAR RATIO":"The ratio of the number of rotations of the driving gear to the number of rotations of the driven gear, determining the mechanical advantage and speed reduction in a gear train.",
    "HEAT EXCHANGER":"A device used to transfer heat between two or more fluids, typically used for heating and cooling processes in various industrial applications.",
    "INDUCTOR":"A passive electrical component consisting of a coil of wire that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. It is used in filters, transformers, and energy storage devices.",
    "JOULE":"A unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI), named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule. It is defined as the amount of energy transferred when a force of one newton is applied over a distance of one meter, or equivalently, as the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second.",
    "KILN":"A high-temperature oven used for firing ceramics, making bricks, and processing other materials that require high heat, often used in construction and manufacturing industries.",
    "LATHE":"A machine tool that rotates a workpiece on its axis to perform various operations, such as cutting, sanding, drilling, and turning, to shape the workpiece into the desired form.",
    "MANOMETER":"An instrument used to measure the pressure of gases or liquids by balancing the fluid column against a known pressure, commonly used in laboratories and industrial applications.",
    "NANOTECHNOLOGY":"The manipulation and control of matter on an atomic and molecular scale, typically below 100 nanometers, to create new materials and devices with unique properties.",
    "ORIFICE PLATE":"A device used to measure the flow rate of fluids in a pipeline by introducing a restriction, causing a pressure drop that can be correlated with the flow rate.",
    "PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT":"The ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress, commonly used in sensors, actuators, and electronic devices.",
    "QUANTUM DOT":"A nanoscale particle that exhibits quantum mechanical properties, often used in displays, solar cells, and biomedical imaging for their unique optical and electronic behavior.",

    "SOLENOID":"A coil of wire that generates a magnetic field when an electric current passes through it, commonly used in electromagnetic devices such as switches, relays, and valves.",
    "THERMOCOUPLE":"A temperature sensor consisting of two different metals joined at one end, generating a voltage proportional to the temperature difference between the joined end and the reference end.",
    "ULTRASONIC SENSOR":"A device that uses high-frequency sound waves to detect the presence, distance, and shape of objects, commonly used in distance measurement, object detection, and level sensing applications.",
    "VALVE":"A mechanical device that controls the flow and pressure of fluids within a system, used in a wide range of applications including plumbing, hydraulic, pneumatic, and industrial processes.",
    "WIND TURBINE":"A device that converts the kinetic energy of wind into mechanical energy, which is then transformed into electrical energy by a generator, commonly used for renewable energy production.",
    "X-RAY DIFFRACTION":"Also called as XRD, is a technique used to study the structure of crystalline materials by analyzing the patterns produced when X-rays are diffracted through the crystal lattice.",
